            Oh, Emmett. Emmett is stubborn but so sweet, a little Velcro strip
            stuck to my pant-leg. He’s lazy and has serious food-hoarding
            issues. But he’ll do absolutely anything we ask of him, especially
            if there’s a treat involved. Emmett loves being the center of
            attention, loves meeting new people, loves going new places. Emmett
            is completely and utterly fearless. He tolerates what he doesn’t
            like – puppies, not being fed on time – with heavy sighs. But he’s
            happy, oh, is he happy. He wags his curly tail with his entire body.
            All he wants out of life is a good snuggle, a tasty snack, and a
            nice, long nap preferably outside, in the sun, on his back.
